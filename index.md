Open-source library for working with:

* crystallographic symmetry,
* macromolecular models (in mmCIF, PDB and mmJSON formats),
* refinement restraints (CIF files),
* crystallographic reflections (MTZ and mmCIF formats),
* data on a 3D grid (electron density maps, masks, MRC/CCP4 format).

For C++11, Python 2/3/PyPy, Fortran 2003+ and (planned) JavaScript.

The library is accompanied by a set of command-line
[tools](https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html) for converting
and validating files,
and&nbsp;for&nbsp;calculation of various properties and metrics
from models, maps and data.

### GEMMI detours

* [periodic table](https://project-gemmi.github.io/periodic-table/)
  as an impractical way of searching PDB
* [PDB statistics](https://project-gemmi.github.io/pdb-stats/) focused
  on the data collection hardware and software; each plot is an interactive filter
* [synchrotron work patterns](https://project-gemmi.github.io/pdb-stats/calendar.html) --
  as seen in the wwPDB data
