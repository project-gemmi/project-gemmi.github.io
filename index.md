A new open-source library under development.
For working with

* mmCIF and PDB files,
* refinement restraints (monomer library)
* crystallographic reflections,
* electron density maps,
* and maybe more.

For C++, C, Fortran 2003+, Python and maybe JS.

More details in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Code: [github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi](https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi)

Documentation: [gemmi.readthedocs.io](https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/)

### GEMMI detours

* [periodic table](https://project-gemmi.github.io/periodic-table/)
  as an impractical way of searching PDB
* [PDB statistics](http://project-gemmi.github.io/pdb-stats/) focused
  on the data collection hardware and software; each plot is an interactive filter
