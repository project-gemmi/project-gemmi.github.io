subh1: General MacroMolecular I/O
---

A new open-source library under development.
For working with:

* crystallographic symmetry,
* macromolecular models (in mmCIF, PDB and mmJSON formats),
* refinement restraints (CIF files),
* data on a 3D grid (electron density maps, masks, MRC/CCP4 format)
* and (planned) crystallographic reflections.

For C++11, Python 2/3/PyPy, Fortran 2003+ and (planned) JavaScript.

More details in 2018 and 2019.

### GEMMI detours

* [periodic table](https://project-gemmi.github.io/periodic-table/)
  as an impractical way of searching PDB
* [PDB statistics](https://project-gemmi.github.io/pdb-stats/) focused
  on the data collection hardware and software; each plot is an interactive filter
* [synchrotron work patterns](https://project-gemmi.github.io/pdb-stats/calendar.html) --
  as seen in the wwPDB data
